### Project Intro - Predicting the Students performance using Machine learning based on their previous data and results for early prevention.
### Data Description - This dataset contains comprehensive information on 2,392 high school students, detailing their demographics, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic performance. The target variable, GradeClass, classifies students' grades into distinct categories, providing a robust dataset for educational research, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis.
### Eda - 1.Univatre anaylsis involve the checking frequncy of some variable like gender and target 2.Bivarte analysis invlove the visualization of various parametrs including gender,age,extracricular,tution,study time .
### Model Buliding - Support Vector Classifier is used for classifying the data with tuning parameters as Randomized searchCv.
### Model Evalution - Metrics is used for evalution to checking classification report and also plot confusion matrix.
### Conclusion - Conclusion is that model is trained with 0.93 accuracy.
